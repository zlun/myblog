##Bachelor of Computer Science Honor Thesis - 2014, Defended in April

The thesis title is Interactive Visualization of User Profile Classifications and Relationships. I propose an interactive visualization system that automatically classifies user profiles and finds their relationships based on the contents of profiles.The system demo is on https://web.cs.dal.ca/~zwu/systemdemo/ and the source codes are in https://github.com/zlun/VisualAnalysis
